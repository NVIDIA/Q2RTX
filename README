Welcome to Q2VKPT, a Quake II engine with real-time path tracing.  This client
implements fully dynamic illumination without precomputation supporting area
light sources, reflections, soft shadows, and indirect illumination. This
client is a port of our real-time path tracer vkpt and is based on the Quake II
engine Q2PRO.

This client requires a high-end GPU supporting the Vulkan extension
VK_NV_ray_tracing.

Please refer to our project page for more details.
