# Quake II RTX

[![Build Status](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**Quake II RTX** is NVIDIA's attempt at implementing a fully functional 
version of Id Software's 1997 hit game **Quake II** with RTX path-traced 
global illumination.

**Quake II RTX** builds upon the [Q2VKPT](http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt) 
branch of the Quake II open source engine. Q2VKPT was created by former 
NVIDIA intern Christoph Schied, a Ph.D. student at the Karlsruhe Institute 
of Technology in Germany.

Q2VKPT, in turn, builds upon [Q2PRO](https://skuller.net/q2pro/), which is a 
modernized version of the Quake II engine. Consequently, many of the settings 
and console variables that work for Q2PRO also work for Quake II RTX.

## Build Instructions

  1. Clone the repository and its submodules from git :

     `git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX.git `

  2. Create a build folder named `build` under the repository root (`Q2RTX/build`)     

     Note: this is required by the shader build rules.

  3. Copy (or create a symbolic link) to the game assets folder (`Q2RTX/baseq2`) 

     Note: the asset packages are required for the engine to run.
     Specifically, the `blue_noise.pkz` and `q2rtx_media.pkz` files or their extracted contents.
     The package files can be found in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX/releases) or in the published builds of Quake II RTX.

  4. Configure CMake with either the GUI or the command line and point the build at the `build` folder
     created in step 2.

     `cd build`  
     `cmake ..`

     **Note**: only 64-bit builds are supported, so make sure to select a 64-bit generator during the initial configuration of CMake.
     
     Note 2: when CMake is configuring `curl`, it will print warnings like `Found no *nroff program`. These can be ignored.

  5. Build with Visual Studio on Windows, make on Linux, or the CMake command
     line:

     `cmake --build . `

## Music Playback Support

Quake II RTX supports music playback from OGG files, if they can be located. To enable music playback, copy the CD tracks into a `music` folder either next to the executable, or inside the game directory, such as `baseq2/music`. The files should use one of these two naming schemes:
  - `music/02.ogg` for music copied directly from a game CD;
  - `music/Track02.ogg` for music from the version of Quake II downloaded from [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_ii_quad_damage).

In the game, music playback is enabled when console variable `ogg_enable` is set to 1. Music volume is controlled by console varaible `ogg_volume`. Playback controls, such as selecting the track or putting it on pause, are available through the `ogg` command.

Music playback support is using code adapted from the [Yamagi Quake 2](https://www.yamagi.org/quake2/) engine.

## Photo Mode

When a single player game or demo playback is paused, normally with the `pause` key, the photo mode activates. 
In this mode, denoisers and some other real-time rendering approximations are disabled, and the image is produced
using accumulation rendering instead. This means that the engine renders the same frame hundreds or thousands of times,
with different noise patterns, and averages the results. Once the image is stable enough, you can save a screenshot.

In addition to rendering higher quality images, the photo mode has some unique features. One of them is the
**Depth of Field** (DoF) effect, which simulates camera aperture and defocus blur, or bokeh. In contrast with DoF effects
used in real-time renderers found in other games, this implementation computes "true" DoF, which works correctly through reflections and refractions, and has no edge artifacts. Unfortunately, it produces a lot of noise instead, so thousands
of frames of accumulation are often needed to get a clean picture. To control DoF in the game, use the mouse wheel and 
`Shift/Ctrl` modifier keys: wheel alone adjusts the focal distance, `Shift+Wheel` adjusts the aperture size, and `Ctrl` makes
the adjustments finer.

Another feature of the photo mode is free camera controls. Once the game is paused, you can move the camera and 
detach it from the character. To move the camera, use the regular `W/A/S/D` keys, plus `Q/E` to move up and down. `Shift` makes
movement faster, and `Ctrl` makes it slower. To change orientation of the camera, move the mouse while holding the left 
mouse button. To zoom, move the mouse up or down while holding the right mouse button. Finally, to adjust camera roll,
move the mouse left or right while holding both mouse buttons.

Settings for all these features can be found in the game menu. To adjust the settings from the console, see the
`pt_accumulation_rendering`, `pt_dof`, `pt_aperture`, `pt_freecam` and some other similar console variables in the 
[Client Manual](doc/client.md).

## Material System

The engine has a system for defining various properties for surface materials, such as textures, material kinds, flags, etc.
Materials are defined in `*.mat` files in a custom text-based format. The engine will read all `materials/*.mat` files from
the game directory (or directories when playing a non-base game) in alphabetic order, and materials in the later files override
the materials in the earlier files. Then the engine also reads a `<mapname>.mat` file when loading a map, and the materials
defined in the map-specific file override global materials - but only those used for map geometry, not models.

The `.mat` files consist of multiple material entries, where each entry can define multiple materials. For example:
```
textures/e1u2/wslt1_5,
textures/e1u2/wslt1_6:
    texture_base overrides/*.tga
    texture_normals overrides/*_n.tga
    texture_emissive overrides/*_light.tga
    is_light 1
    correct_albedo 1
```

The above example defines two materials that will be used for surfaces that reference `.wal` files with the same base names,
and for each of these materials it defines three textures. The `*` symbol in the texture definition is replaced with the
material base name, so either `wslt1_5` or `wslt1_6` in this example.

When a material is not defined for a surface, the engine will look for textures with matching names and various extensions.
First, it will look in the `overrides/` directory, then in the original texture path. Normal maps are searched with the `_n`
suffix, and emissive maps are searched with the `_light` suffix. If no replacement files are found, just the original base
texture will be used.

Materials can also use the automatic emissive texture generation feature. This is the case for undefined materials when the
`pt_enable_surface_lights` console variable is nonzero: wall surfaces with the `SURF_LIGHT` flag (but not `SURF_SKY` or
`SURF_NODRAW`) will generate an emissive texture from the base texture and a threshold value, if no emissive texture is found,
and marked with the `is_light` material flag.
The threshold value is set using the `pt_surface_lights_threshold` variable.
For defined materials you can the `synth_emissive` and `emissive_threshold` material properties to explicitly enable
emissive texture generation.

Materials can be examined and modified at run time, using the `mat` command. For example, `mat print` will print the properties
of the currently targeted material to the console. To get more usage information, use `mat help`.

## MIDI Controller Support

The Quake II console can be remote operated through a UDP connection, which
allows users to control in-game effects from input peripherals such as MIDI controllers. This is 
useful for tuning various graphics parameters such as position of the sun, intensities of lights, 
material parameters, filter settings, etc.

You can find a compatible MIDI controller driver [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/korgi)

To enable remote access to your Quake II RTX client, you will need to set the following 
console variables _before_ starting the game, i.e. in the config file or through the command line:
```
 rcon_password "<password>"
 backdoor "1"
```

Note: the password set here should match the password specified in the korgi configuration file.

Note 2: enabling the rcon backdoor allows other people to issue console commands to your game from 
other computers, so choose a good password.

## Test Model

The engine includes support for placing a test model in any location. You can use any MD2, MD3 or IQM model. Follow these steps to use this feature:

  - To use the material sampling balls model, download the `shader_balls.pkz` package from the [Releases](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX/releases) page. Place or extract that package into your `baseq2` folder.
  - Run the game with the `cl_testmodel` variable set to the path of the test model.
  - Use the `puttest` command to place the test model at the current player location.
  - Adjust the test model animation speed with the `cl_testfps` variable and its opacity with the `cl_testalpha` variable.
