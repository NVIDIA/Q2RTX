# Example Q2PRO build time configuration file. Copy this file to `.config' and
# edit it to suit your needs.
#
# Any variable that is commented out is DISABLED. Setting a variable to some
# non-empty value ENABLES it. It doesn't really matter what value the variable
# is set to, except in cases where the variable is NOT a boolean.
#
# After you change something in `.config', make sure to do a full rebuild by
# typing `make clean; make'.


### Client configuration ###

# Enable PNG textures by linking against libpng.
#CONFIG_PNG=y

# Enable JPEG textures by linking against libjpeg.
#CONFIG_JPEG=y

# Enable HTTP downloads by linking against libcurl.
#CONFIG_HTTP=y

# Enable reading input events from LIRC by linking against liblirc_client.
# This option has no effect on Windows.
#CONFIG_LIRC=y

# Enable X11 support in SDL video driver by linking against libX11. Currently,

# console from the X selection buffer. This option has no effect on Windows.
#CONFIG_X11=y

# Build software renderer instead of OpenGL renderer.
#CONFIG_SOFTWARE_RENDERER=y

# Specify default list of fullscreen modes. Note: modes are automatically
# detected on Windows. Default list is only used when autodetection fails.

# Specify default window geometry.
#CONFIG_DEFAULT_GEOMETRY=640x480

# Disable default Quake 2 software sound engine. Only makes sense when
# CONFIG_OPENAL is set.
#CONFIG_NO_SOFTWARE_SOUND=y

# Disable automatic discovery of evdev device nodes by not linking
# against libudev. This option has no effect on platforms other than Linux.
# This option has no effect unless CONFIG_DIRECT_INPUT is set.
#CONFIG_NO_UDEV=y

# Disable menu-based user interface. This disables scriptable menus, as well as
# demo and server browsers.
#CONFIG_NO_MENUS=y

# Disable dynamic lighting.

#CONFIG_MVD_CLIENT=y


### X86 options ###

# Options below have no effect on architectures other than x86.

# Build x86 assembly versions of certain C routines. Mostly useful for software
# renderer.
#CONFIG_X86_ASSEMBLY=y

# Enable this option on Linux to build a server capable of loading game mods
# built using ancient GCC versions.
#CONFIG_X86_GAME_ABI_HACK=y


### Common configuration ###

# Enable this when targeting native Windows.

# Enable built-in tests. DON'T USE IN RELEASE BUILDS.
#CONFIG_TESTS=y

# Enable debugging and developer code.
#CONFIG_DEBUG=y

# Don't link against zlib. Not recommended for client builds, since lack of
# zlib support breaks compatibility with servers running protocol 35.
#CONFIG_NO_ZLIB=y

# Don't handle ICMP errors on UDP sockets.
#CONFIG_NO_ICMP=y

# Don't print console text on standard output and don't read commands from
# standard input.
#CONFIG_NO_SYSTEM_CONSOLE=y


### Game directories ###

# Name of the game directory used as base game directory. Default value is
# "baseq2". Change this when creating a standalone game using Q2PRO engine.
#CONFIG_GAME_BASE=baseq2

# Name of the game directory used as default game directory. Default value is
# empty. This option sets the default value of "game" console variable. Change
# this for building a version of Q2PRO customized for particular game mod, e.g.
# "action".
#CONFIG_GAME_DEFAULT=


### System paths ###

# By default Q2PRO assumes per-user installation: all game content, configs and
# executable files are kept in the same directory tree. This configuration is
# easy for most users to set up, but not ideal from security standpoint.
#
# Uncomment the options below if you wish to install Q2PRO system-wide,
# separating static, executable and writable content into different trees with
# different permissions.  These options have no effect on Windows.

# Path to the game data tree. This is where all static, non-executable data
# lives (e.g., paks). This option sets the default value of "basedir" console
# variable. Default value of this option is "." (current directory).
#CONFIG_PATH_DATA=/usr/local/share/games/q2pro

# Path to the game libraries tree. This is where executable parts of all game
# mods live (e.g., game$(CPU).so files). This option sets the default value of
# "libdir" console variable. Default value of this option is "." (current
# directory).
#CONFIG_PATH_LIB=/usr/local/lib/games/q2pro

# Name of the directory where Q2PRO stores per-user data. Tilde at the
# beginning of the name is automatically expanded to user home directory at run
# time. Users running Q2PRO must have write permissions to this directory.
# This option sets the default value of "homedir" console variable. Default
# value of this option is "" (use basedir as homedir).
#CONFIG_PATH_HOME=~/.q2pro
