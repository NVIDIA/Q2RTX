About
-----
Q2RTX is built upon Q2VKPT and Q2PRO source ports of Quake 2 and inherits
most of their settings and commands, listed in this manual. It also adds
many settings and commands of its own, also listed here. Many of them
are primarily intended for renderer development and debugging.

Q2PRO is an enhanced, multiplayer oriented Quake 2 client, compatible
with existing Quake 2 ports and licensed under GPLv2. This document provides
descriptions of console variables and commands added to or modified by Q2PRO
since the original Quake 2 release. Cvars and commands inherited from original
Quake 2 are not described here (yet).

Variables
---------

### Netcode

Q2PRO client supports separation of outgoing packet rate, physics frame rate
and rendering frame rate. Separation of physics and rendering frame rates is
accomplished in R1Q2 `cl_async` style and is enabled by default.

In addition to this, Q2PRO network protocol is able to pack several input
commands into the single network packet for outgoing packet rate reduction.
This is very useful for some types of network links like Wi-Fi that can't deal
with large number of small packets and cause packet delay or loss. Q2PRO
protocol is only in use when connected to a Q2PRO server.

For the default Quake 2 protocol and R1Q2 protocol a hacky solution exists,
which exploits dropped packet recovery mechanism for the purpose of packet
rate reduction. This hack is disabled by default.

#### `cl_protocol`
Specifies preferred network protocol version to use when connecting to
servers.  If the server doesn't support the specified protocol, client will
fall back to the previous supported version. Default value is 0.

- 0 — automatically select the highest protocol version supported
- 34 — use default Quake 2 protocol
- 35 — use enhanced R1Q2 protocol
- 36 — use enhanced Q2PRO protocol

#### `cl_maxpackets`
Number of packets client sends per second. 0 means no particular limit.
Unless connected using Q2PRO protocol, this variable is ignored and packets
are sent in sync with client physics frame rate, controlled with
`cl_maxfps` variable. Default value is 30.

#### `cl_fuzzhack`
Enables `cl_maxpackets` limit even if Q2PRO protocol is not in use by
dropping packets. This is not a generally recommended thing to do, but can
be enabled if nothing else helps to reduce ping. Default value is 0
(disabled).

#### `cl_packetdup`
Number of backup movement commands client includes in each new packet,
directly impacts upload rate. Unless connected using Q2PRO protocol,
hardcoded value of 2 backups per packet is used. Default value is 1.

#### `cl_instantpacket`
Specifies if important events such as pressing `+attack` or `+use` are sent
to the server immediately, ignoring any rate limits. Default value is 1
(enabled).

#### `cl_async`
Controls rendering frame rate and physics frame rate separation. Default
value is 1. Influence of `cl_async` on client framerates is summarized in
the table below.

- 0 — run synchronous, like original Quake 2 does
- 1 — run asynchronous
- 2 — run asynchronous, limit rendering frame rate to monitor's vertical
  retrace frequency (supported only by X11/GLX drivers)

Rate limits depending on `cl_async` value:

| Value of `cl_async` | Rendering          | Physics     | Main loop   |
|---------------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0                   | `cl_maxfps`        | `cl_maxfps` | `cl_maxfps` |
| 1                   | `r_maxfps`         | `cl_maxfps` | unlimited   |
| 2                   | vertical refresh   | `cl_maxfps` | unlimited   |

#### `r_maxfps`
Specifies maximum rendering frame rate if `cl_async` is set to 1, otherwise
ignored.  Default value is 0, which means no particular limit.

#### `cl_maxfps`
Specifies client physics frame rate if `cl_async` 1 or 2 is used.
Otherwise, limits both rendering and physics frame rates. Default value is
60.

#### `cl_gibs`
Controls rendering of entities with `EF_GIB` flag set. When using Q2PRO
protocol, disabling this saves some bandwidth since the server stops
sending these entities at all. Default value is 1 (enabled).

#### `cl_gun`
Controls rendering of the player's own gun model. When using R1Q2 or Q2PRO
protocol, disabling this saves some bandwidth since the server stops
sending gun updates at all. Default value is 1 (enabled).

#### `cl_footsteps`
Controls footstep sounds. When using Q2PRO protocol, disabling this saves
some bandwidth since the server stops sending footstep events at all.
Default value is 1 (enabled).

#### `cl_updaterate`
Specifies the perferred update rate requested from Q2PRO servers. Only used
when server is running in variable FPS mode, otherwise default rate of 10
packets per second is used. Specified rate should evenly divide native
server frame rate.  Default value is 0, which means to use the highest
update rate available (that is, native server frame rate).


### Network

#### `net_enable_ipv6`
Enables IPv6 support. Default value is 1 on systems that support IPv6 and 0
otherwise.

- 0 — disable IPv6, use IPv4 only
- 1 — enable IPv6, but prefer IPv4 over IPv6 when resolving host names
  with multiple addresses
- 2 — enable IPv6, use normal address resolver priority configured by OS

#### `net_ip`
Specifies network interface address client should use for outgoing UDP
connections using IPv4.  Default value is empty, which means that default
network interface is used.

#### `net_ip6`
Specifies network interface address client should use for outgoing UDP
connections using IPv6.  Default value is empty, which means that default
network interface is used. Has no effect unless `net_enable_ipv6` is set to
non-zero value.

#### `net_clientport`
Specifies UDP port number client should use for outgoing connections (using
IPv4 or IPv6).  Default value is -1, which means that random port number is
chosen at socket creation time.

#### `net_maxmsglen`
Specifies maximum server to client packet size client will request from
servers. 0 means no hard limit. Default value is conservative 1390 bytes.
It is nice to have this variable as close to your network link MTU as
possible (accounting for headers). Thus for normal Ethernet MTU of 1500
bytes 1462 can be specified (10 bytes quake header, 8 bytes UDP header, 20
bytes IPv4 header). Higher values may cause IP fragmentation which is
better to avoid. Servers will cap this variable to their own maximum
values.  Please don't change this variable unless you know exactly what you
are doing.

#### `net_chantype`
Specifies if enhanced Q2PRO network channel implementation is enabled when
connecting to Q2PRO servers. Q2PRO netchan supports application-level
fragmentation of datagrams that results is better gamestate compression
ratio and faster map load times.  Default value is 1 (enabled).

### Triggers

#### `cl_beginmapcmd`
Specifies command to be executed each time client enters a new map. Default
value is empty.

#### `cl_changemapcmd`
Specifies command to be executed each time client begins loading a new map.
Default value is empty.

#### `cl_disconnectcmd`
Specifies command to be executed each time client disconnects from the
server. Default value is empty.

See also `trigger` client command description.


### Effects

replaced with sprites. Affects both OpenGL and RTX renderers. Default value is 1.

#### `cl_dlight_hacks`
Toggles miscellaneous dynamic light effects options. This variable
is a bitmask. Default value is 0.
  - 1 — make rocket projectile light red instead of yellow
  - 2 — make rocket/grenade explosion light radius smaller
  - 4 — disable muzzle flashes for machinegun and chaingun

#### `cl_noglow`
Disables the glowing effect on bonus entities like ammo, health, etc.
Default value is 0 (glowing enabled).

#### `cl_gunalpha`
Specifies opacity level of the player's own gun model. Default value is 1
(fully opaque).

Multiplier for the count of particles generated for various effects such as water 
splashes. Default value is 1.

### Sound Subsystem

#### `s_enable`
Specifies which sound engine to use. Default value is 2.

- 0 — sound is disabled
- 1 — use DMA (software mixer) sound engine
- 2 — use OpenAL sound engine if available, DMA otherwise

#### `s_ambient`

- 2 — only ambient sounds from visible entities are enabled (rocket
    flybys, etc)
- 3 — only ambient sounds from player entity are enabled (railgun hum,
    hand grenade ticks, etc)

#### `s_auto_focus`
Specifies the minimum focus level main Q2PRO window should have for sound
to be activated.  Default value is 0.

  - 0 — sound is always activated
  - 1 — sound is activated when main window is visible, and deactivated
  when it is iconified, or moved to another desktop
  - 2 — sound is activated when main window has input focus, and deactivated
  when it loses it

#### `s_khz`
Specifies the sound sampling rate, in kHz. Default value is 44.

#### `s_mixahead`
Specifies the amount of time between sound being mixed and played, in seconds.
Lower values make sound more responsive, but it may become unstable. Higher values
add more delay. Only affects the DMA sound engine. Default value is 0.1.

#### `s_swapstereo`:
Swap left and right audio channels. Only effective when using DMA sound
engine. Default value is 0 (don't swap).

#### `al_driver`
Specifies the name of OpenAL driver to use. Default value is `openal32`
on Windows, and ‘libopenal.so.1’ on Linux.

#### `al_device`
Specifies the name of OpenAL device to use. Format of this value depends on
your OpenAL implementation. Default value is empty, which means default
sound output device is used.

*TIP*: On Windows, there are two well-known OpenAL implementations available:
[OpenAL32](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/) from Creative, with
support for harware acceleration on certain audio cards, and an open source
software implementation named [OpenAL Soft](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html).
Both should work with Q2PRO, but to get the results most perceptually close to
original Quake 2 sound, I recommend using OpenAL Soft. Creative's
implementation seems to perform some default effects processing even when not
requested, and that makes it sound somewhat differently. With OpenAL Soft in
stereo configuration I can't really tell if I'm using OpenAL or default Quake 2
sound engine. Of course you can install both implementations and switch between
them by changing `al_driver` variable between `openal32` and `soft_oal`.

### Video Modes

Hard coded list of the fullscreen video modes is gone from Q2PRO, you can
specify your own list in configuration files. Vertical refresh frequency _freq_
and bit depth `bpp` can be specified individually for each mode.

Video mode change no longer requires `vid_restart` and is nearly instant.  In
windowed mode, size as well as position of the main window can be changed
freely.

#### `vid_modelist`

32 bit framebuffer depth, and select the last 800x600 mode.
```
/set vid_modelist "640x480@75:32 800x600@75:32"
/set vid_fullscreen 2
```

### Windows Specific

The following variables are specific to the Windows port of Q2PRO.

be obscured by other windows).

#### `win_xpfix`
Temporary disables mouse acceleration setting applied by the OS. Only
effective when legacy Windows mouse input is in use, otherwise ignored.
Default value is 0 (don't modify OS setting).

#### `win_rawmouse`
Enables raw mouse input instead of legacy Windows mouse input. Default
value is 1 (use raw input).

### Vulkan RTX Renderer

*NOTE*: The variables are listed here in a mostly alphabetic order. Many of them
are intended for renderer development and tuning. Advanced parameters are not 
listed here, but they can be found in [global_ubo.h](../src/refresh/vkpt/shader/global_ubo.h).

#### `bloom_enable`
Enables the bloom post-processing effect. Default value is 1.

#### `bloom_intensity`
Controls the blending intensity of the bloom effect, with 0 meaning no bloom,
and 1 meaning the image completely replaced with bloom. Default value is 0.002.

#### `bloom_intensity_water`
Controls the blending intensity of the bloom effect when the player is underwater.
Default value is 0.2.

#### `bloom_sigma`
Controls the width of the bloom effect, in fractions of the screen height. Default 
value is 0.037.

#### `bloom_sigma_water`
Controls the width of the bloom effect when the player is underwater. Default value is 0.037.

#### `cl_shaderballs`
Enables loading and displaying the "shader balls" model. The model is loaded from the
`develop/objects/ShaderBallArray/ShaderBallArray16.MD3` file in the game filesystem.
Once loaded, the model is placed in the world origin (0) location and can be moved with
the [`drop_balls`](#drop_balls) command.

#### `drs_enable`
Enables the Dynamic Resolution Scaling (DRS) system. When enabled, the renderer
will try to keep the target frame rate specified as `drs_target` FPS by adjusting the 
resolution scale between `drs_minscale` and `drs_maxscale` percent. Default value is 0.

#### `drs_target`
Target frame rate for the DRS system, in frames per second. Default value is 60.

#### `drs_minscale`
Minimum resolution scale for DRS, in percents. If the current resolution scale is at that 
value and the frame rate is still lower than `drs_target`, the scale will not be reduced 
further. Default value is 50%.

#### `drs_maxscale`
Maximum resolution scale for DRS, in percents. If the current resolution scale is at that 
value and the frame rate is still higher than `drs_target`, the scale will not be increased 
further. Default value is 100%.

#### `drs_adjust_up`
Specifies the percentage of target frame time when the DRS system starts adjusting
the resolution scale up. For example, when target frame rate `drs_target` is 60 and 
`drs_adjust_up` is 0.92, the resolution will be reduced if actual frame time exceeds 
(1000 / 60) * 0.98 = 16.33 ms. Default value is 0.98.

#### `drs_adjust_down`
Specifies the percentage of target frame time when the DRS system starts adjusting
the resolution scale down. For example, when target frame rate `drs_target` is 60 and 
`drs_adjust_down` is 0.98, the resolution will be reduced if actual frame time exceeds 
(1000 / 60) * 0.98 = 15.33 ms. Default value is 0.92.

#### `drs_gain`
Multiplier for the actual to target frame time ratio that is used to compute the amount
of resolution scale adjustment. Higher values mean quicker reaction to frame time changes.
Default value is 20.

#### `flt_enable`
Enables the post-raytracing filter stack, including denoising and temporal antialiasing.
Default value is 1.

#### `flt_fixed_albedo`
If set to a nonzero value, replaces surface albedo with that value after filtering.
Use this setting for a "no-textures" mode. Default value is 0.

#### `flt_scale_lf`, `flt_scale_hf`, `flt_scale_spec`
Scales for the three lighting denoiser channels. Default values are all 1.

#### `flt_scale_overlay`
Scale for the overlay (transparency) channel that is not denoised. Default value is 1.

#### `flt_show_gradients`
Enables the display of inter-frame gradients that are used for temporal filtering.
Red channel shows low-frequency (GI) gradients, green channel shows direct diffuse gradients,
and blue channel shows direct specular gradients. Default value is 0.

#### `flt_taa`
Enables temporal anti-aliasing and primary ray direction jitter. Default value is 1.

#### `flt_fsr_enable`
Enables FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 ("AMD FSR 1.0") upscaling. Default value is 0.
If enabled, upscaling is applied when the resolution scale is below 100%, either from
dynamic resolution scaling or by setting a fixes resolution scale.

There's currently no UI to choose the AMD FSR 1.0 quality mode.
You can closely approximate that setting by using an appropriate fixed
resolution scale:
| AMD FSR 1.0 Quality Mode | Fixed resolution scale |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Ultra Quality            | 75%                    |
| Quality                  | 65%                    |
| Balanced                 | 60%                    |
| Performance              | 50%                    |

#### `flt_fsr_sharpness`
FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 sharpening amount. Default is 0.2.
Range is from 0.0 to 2.0, with lower meaning sharper.

#### `flt_fsr_easu`, `flt_fsr_rcas`
Individual control of the upscaling and sharpening steps of FSR. Both default to 1.
Intended for testing purposes.

#### `gr_enable`
Enables the god rays (volumetric lighting) effect. Default value is 1.

#### `gr_eccentricity`
Controls the eccentricity parameter of the volumetric lighting effect's scattering function
(Henyey-Greenstein scattering). The value can be between -1 and 1, where 1 means that all 
light is scattered in the direction of the incoming light or forward scattering, 0 means
uniform scatter, and -1 means back scattering. Default value is 0.75.

#### `gr_intensity`

Number of reflection or refraction bounces to trace. Default value is 2.

#### `pt_roughness_override`
Global override for roughness of all materials. Negative values mean there is no
override. Default value is -1.

#### `pt_show_sky`
Enables visualization of skybox geometry, useful for tuning maps for the RTX renderer
because one can use the `cl_clusterthere` macro to display the clusters for the sky
and list those clusters in map-specific sky cluster file, `maps/sky/<mapname>.txt`.
Default value is 0.

#### `pt_texture_lod_bias`
LOD bias for texture sampling. Negative values mean sharper textures, positive values 
mean blurrier textures. Default value is 0.

- 1 — enable physically accurate thick glass refraction and reflection in the photo mode only
- 2 — enable accurate thick glass refraction in the photo mode, and less accurate in the real-time mode

#### `pt_water_density`
Extinction coefficient scaler for water, slime and lava. Higher values make water thicker.

Changing the value of `sli` will invoke `vid_restart` and can be done without
restarting the game. Default value is 1.

#### `sun_angle`
Angular size of the sun in the sky, in degrees. This variable is set automatically
when `physical_sky` is modified. Default value is 1.0.

#### `sun_animate`
When this cvar has nonzero value, the sun will move around the sky with speed
proportional to the value. Default value is 0.

*NOTE*: Using the `sun_animate` mode makes the game slower because any 
change in sun direction results in an environment map update. Same argument
applies to moving the sun in real time with a gamepad or through rcon.

#### `sun_azimuth`
Azimuth (horizontal direction) of the sun in the sky, in degrees. Only effective 
if `sun_preset` is set to 0. Default value is 345.

#### `sun_latitude`
Latitude (on Earth) of the game location that is used to compute the 
direction of the sun in automatic presets, i.e. when `sun_preset` is set
to 1 or 2. Default value is 32.9, which is the latitude of of former
headquarters of id Software in Richardson, Texas.

#### `sun_preset`
Controls how the sun direction is set. Default value is 5 (morning).

- 1 — automatic sun positioning using the system clock
- 2 — automatic sun positioning using the system clock multiplied by 12
- 3 — night (elevation -90, azimuth 0)
- 4 — dawn (elevation -3, azimuth 0)
- 5 — morning (elevation 25, azimuth -15)
- 6 — noon (elevation 80, azimuth -75)
- 7 — evening (elevation 15, azimuth 190)

#### `tm_enable`
Enables the tone mapper, otherwise the game shows the HDR image clipped to 
the display range. Default value is 1.

#### `tm_exposure_bias`
Exposure bias for the tone mapper. Positive values make the image brighter.
Default value is -1.0.

darker. Default values are 2.0 and 1.0, respectively.

#### `tm_min_luminance`, `tm_max_luminance`
Minimum and maximum luminance values for the auto-exposure adjustment.
Can be adjusted if some areas appear too dark although there is some light there.
Default values are 0.0002 and 1.0, respectively.

#### `tm_reinhard`
This parameter is used to blend between the output of the adaptive curve tone
mapper (0.0) and the Reinhard auto-exposure tone mapper (1.0). Higher values 
give more contrast, lower values give more detail in the shadows but also crush
the highlights. More information about the tone mapper can be found in 
[tone_mapping_histogram.comp](../src/refresh/vkpt/shader/tone_mapping_histogram.comp).
Default value is 0.5.

#### `viewsize`
Controls the resolution scale in percents. Default value is 100. The variable
name is legacy for the setting that used to control viewport size, and it
can be adjusted with the `+` and `-` keys. Also see the DRS cvars,
such as [`drs_enable`](#drs_enable). Default value is 100.


### OpenGL Renderer

#### `gl_gamma_scale_pics`
Apply software gamma scaling not only to textures and skins, but to HUD
pictures also. Default value is 0 (don't apply to pics).

#### `gl_noscrap`
By default, OpenGL renderer combines small HUD pictures into the single
texture called scrap. This usually speeds up rendering a bit, and allows
pixel precise rendering of non power of two sized images. If you don't like
this optimization for some reason, this cvar can be used to disable it.
Default value is 0 (optimize).

#### `gl_bilerp_chars`
Enables bilinear filtering of charset images. Default value is 0 (disabled).

#### `gl_bilerp_pics`
Enables bilinear filtering of HUD pictures. Default value is 1.

  - 2 — enabled for all pictures, including the scrap texture itself

#### `gl_upscale_pcx`
Enables upscaling of PCX images using HQ2x and HQ4x filters. This improves
rendering quality when screen scaling is used. Default value is 0.
  - 0 — don't upscale
  - 1 — upscale 2x (takes 5x more memory)
  - 2 — upscale 4x (takes 21x more memory)

#### `gl_texture_non_power_of_two`
Enables use of non power-of-two sized textures without resampling on OpenGL
3.0 and higher compliant hardware. Default value is 1.

#### `gl_downsample_skins`
Specifies if skins are downsampled just like world textures are. When
disabled, `gl_round_down`, `gl_picmip` cvars have no effect on skins.
Default value is 1 (downsampling enabled).

#### `gl_drawsky`
Enable skybox texturing. 0 means to draw sky box in solid black color.
Default value is 1 (enabled).

#### `gl_fontshadow`
Specifies font shadow width, in pixels, ranging from 0 to 2. Default value
is 0 (no shadow).

#### `gl_partscale`
Specifies minimum size of particles. Default value is 2.

#### `gl_partstyle`
Specifies drawing style of particles. Default value is 0.
  - 0 — blend colors
  - 1 — saturate colors

#### `gl_celshading`
Enables drawing black contour lines around 3D models (aka `celshading`).
Value of this variable specifies thickness of the lines drawn. Default
value is 0 (celshading disabled).

#### `gl_dotshading`
Enables dotshading effect when drawing 3D models, which helps them look
truly 3D-ish by simulating diffuse lighting from a fake light source.
Default value is 1 (enabled).

#### `gl_saturation`
Enables grayscaling of world textures. 1 keeps original colors, 0 converts
textures to grayscale format (this may save some video memory and speed up
rendering a bit since textures are uploaded at 8 bit per pixel instead of
24), any value in between reduces colorfulness. Default value is 1 (keep
original colors).

#### `gl_invert`
Inverts colors of world textures. In combination with ‘gl_saturation 0’
effectively makes textures look like black and white photo negative.
Default value is 0 (do not invert colors).

#### `gl_anisotropy`
When set to 2 and higher, enables anisotropic filtering of world textures,
if supported by your OpenGL implementation. Default value is 8.

#### `gl_brightness`
Specifies a brightness value that is added to each pixel of world
lightmaps. Positive values make lightmaps brighter, negative values make
lightmaps darker.  Default value is 0 (keep original brightness).

#### `gl_coloredlightmaps`
Enables grayscaling of world lightmaps. 1 keeps original colors, 0 converts
lightmaps to grayscale format, any value in between reduces colorfulness.
Default value is 1 (keep original colors).

#### `gl_modulate`
Specifies a primary modulation factor that each pixel of world lightmaps is
multiplied by. This cvar affects entity lighting as well.  Default value is
1 (identity).

#### `gl_modulate_world`
Specifies an secondary modulation factor that each pixel of world lightmaps
is multiplied by. This cvar does not affect entity lighting. Default value
is 1 (identity).

#### `gl_modulate_entities`
Specifies an secondary modulation factor that entity lighting is multiplied
by.  This cvar does not affect world lightmaps. Default value is 1
(identity).

*TIP*: An old trick to make entities look brighter in Quake 2 was setting
`gl_modulate` to a high value without issuing `vid_restart` afterwards. This
way it was possible to keep `gl_modulate` from applying to world lightmaps, but
only until the next map was loaded. In Q2PRO this trick is no longer needed
(and it won't work, since `gl_modulate` is applied dynamically). To get the
similar effect, set the legacy `gl_modulate` variable to 1, and configure
`gl_modulate_world` and `gl_modulate_entities` to suit your needs.

#### `gl_doublelight_entities`
Specifies if combined modulation factor is applied to entity lighting one
more time just before final lighting value is calculated, to simulate a bug
(?) in the original Quake 2 renderer. Default value is 1 (apply twice).

#### Entity lighting
Entity lighting is calculated based on the color of the lightmap sample from
the world surface directly beneath the entity. This means any cvar affecting
lightmaps affects entity lighting as well (with exception of `gl_modulate_world`).
Cvars that have effect only on the entity lighting are `gl_modulate_entities`
and `gl_doublelight_entities`. Yet another cvar affecting entity lighting is
`gl_dotshading`, which typically makes entities look a bit brighter. See also
`cl_noglow` cvar which removes the pulsing effect (glowing) on bonus entities.

#### `gl_dynamic`
Controls dynamic lightmap updates. Default value is 1.

- 0 — all dynamic lighting is disabled
- 1 — all dynamic lighting is enabled
- 2 — most dynamic lights are disabled, but lightmap updates are still
    allowed for switchable lights to work

*NOTE*: Dynamic lights may noticeably hurt rendering performance on some video
cards and drivers, therefore they are disabled by default.

#### `gl_dlight_falloff`
Makes dynamic lights look a bit smoother, opposed to original jagged Quake
2 style.  Default value is 1 (enabled).

#### `gl_fragment_program`
Enables `GL_ARB_fragment_program` extension, if supported by your OpenGL
implementation.  Currently this extension is used only for warping effect
when drawing liquid surfaces. Default value is 1 (enabled).

#### `gl_vertex_buffer_object`
Enables `GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object` extension, if supported by your
OpenGL implementation. This extension allows world surfaces to be stored in
high-performance video memory, which usually speeds up rendering. Default
value is 1 (enabled).

#### `gl_video_sync`
On X11/GLX, enables `GLX_SGI_video_sync` extension. This extension allows
synchronizing rendering framerate to monitor vertical retrace frequency.
Default value is 1 (enabled). See also `cl_async` variable.

#### `gl_colorbits`
Specifies desired size of color buffer, in bits, requested from OpenGL
implementation (should be typically 0, 24 or 32). Default value is 0
(determine the best value automatically).

#### `gl_depthbits`
Specifies desired size of depth buffer, in bits, requested from OpenGL
implementation (should be typically 0 or 24). Default value is 0
(determine the best value automatically).

#### `gl_stencilbits`
Specifies desired size of stencil buffer, in bits, requested from OpenGL
implementation (should be typically 0 or 8). Currently stencil buffer is
used only for drawing projection shadows. Default value is 8. 0 means no
stencil buffer requested.

#### `gl_multisamples`
Specifies number of samples per pixel used to implement multisample
anti-aliasing, if supported by OpenGL implementation. Values 0 and 1 are
equivalent and disable MSAA. Values from 2 to 32 enable MSAA. Default
value is 0.

#### `gl_texturebits`
Specifies number of bits per texel used for internal texture storage
(should be typically 0, 8, 16 or 32). Default value is 0 (choose the best
internal format automatically).

#### `gl_screenshot_format`
Specifies image format `screenshot` command uses. Possible values are
"png", "jpg" and "tga". Default value is "jpg".

#### `gl_screenshot_quality`
Specifies image quality of JPG screenshots. Values range from 0 (worst
quality) to 100 (best quality). Default value is 100.

#### `gl_screenshot_compression`
Specifies compression level of PNG screenshots. Values range from 0 (no
compression) to 9 (best compression). Default value is 6.

#### `gl_screenshot_template`
Specifies filename template in "fileXXX" format for ‘screenshot’ command.
Template must contain at least 3 and at most 9 consecutive ‘X’ in the last
component. Template may contain slashes to save under subdirectory. Default
value is "quakeXXX".

#### `gl_shadows`
Enables rendering of shadows under dynamic entities. Default value is 1.

#### `r_override_textures`
Enables automatic overriding of palettized textures (in WAL or PCX format)
with truecolor replacements (in PNG, JPG or TGA format) by stripping off
original file extension and searching for alternative filenames in the
order specified by `r_texture_formats` variable. Default value is 1
(enabled).

#### `r_texture_formats`
Specifies the order in which truecolor texture replacements are searched.
Default value is "pjt", which means to try ‘.png’ extension first, then
‘.jpg’, then ‘.tga’.

#### `vid_gamma`
Gamma setting for the OpenGL renderer. The RTX renderer uses a more 
sophisticated tone mapping system. Default value is 0.8.

#### .MD2 model overrides
When Q2PRO attempts to load an alias model from disk, it determines actual
model format by file contents, rather than by filename extension. Therefore, if
you wish to override MD2 model with MD3 replacement, simply rename the MD3
model to ‘tris.md2’ and place it in appropriate packfile to make sure it gets
loaded first.

1 (enabled).

#### `cl_http_filelists`
When a first file is about to be downloaded from HTTP server, send a
filelist request, and download any additional files specified in the filelist.

of requesting files one-by-one. Default value is 1 (request filelists).

#### `cl_http_max_connections`
Maximum number of simultaneous connections to the HTTP server. Default
value is 2.

#### `cl_http_proxy`
HTTP proxy server to use for downloads. Default value is empty (direct
connection).


### Locations

Client side location files provide a way to report player's position on the map
in team chat messages without depending on the game mod.  Locations are loaded
from ‘locs/<mapname>.loc’ file. Once location file is loaded, `loc_here` and
`loc_there` macros will expand to the name of location closest to the given
position. Variables listed below control some aspects of location selection.

#### `loc_trace`
When enabled, location must be directly visible from the given position
(not obscured by solid map geometry) in order to be selected. Default value
is 0, which means any closest location will satisfy, even if it is placed
behind the wall.

#### `loc_dist`
Maximum distance to the location, in world units, for it to be considered
by the location selection algorithm. Default value is 500.

#### `loc_draw`
Enables visualization of location positions. Default value is 0 (disabled).


### Mouse Input

On Linux, enables Evdev interface for direct mouse input. Otherwise,
standard input facilities provided by the window system are used. Default
value is 1 (use direct input).

#### `in_device`
On Linux, specifies device file to use for direct mouse input. Normally, it
should be one of ‘/dev/input/eventX’ files (reading permissions are
required).  Default value is empty and needs to be filled by user.

#### `in_grab`
Specifies mouse grabbing policy in windowed mode. Normally, mouse is always
grabbed in-game and released when console or menu is up. In addition to
that, smart policy mode automatically releases the mouse when its input is
not needed (playing a demo, or spectating a player). Default value is 1.

- 0 — don't grab mouse
- 1 — normal grabbing policy
- 2 — smart grabbing policy

#### `m_autosens`
Enables automatic scaling of mouse sensitivity proportional to the current
player field of view. Values between 90 and 179 specify the default FOV
value to scale sensitivity from. Zero disables automatic scaling. Any other
value assumes default FOV of 90 degrees. Default value is 0.

#### `m_accel`
Specifies mouse acceleration factor. Default value is 0 (acceleration
disabled).

#### `m_filter`
When enabled, mouse movement is averaged between current and previous
samples.  Default value is 0 (filtering disabled).

#### `lirc_enable`
On Linux, enables input from the LIRC daemon, which allows menu navigation
and command execution from your infrared remote control device. Default
value is 0 (disabled).

#### `lirc_config`
On Linux, specifies LIRC configuration file to use. Default value is empty,
which means to use the default `~/.lircrc` file. This variable may only be
set from command line.  See README.lirc file for command syntax description.

### Miscellaneous

#### `cl_chat_notify`
Specifies whether to display chat lines in the notify area. Default value
is 1 (enabled).

#### `cl_chat_sound`
Specifies sound effect to play each time chat message is received. Default
value is 1.

#### `cl_chat_filter`
Specifies if unprintable characters are filtered from incoming chat
messages, to prevent common exploits like hiding player names. Default
value is 0 (don't filter).

#### `cl_noskins`
Restricts which models and skins players can use. Default value is 0.

- 0 — no restrictions, if skins exists, it will be loaded
- 1 — do not allow any skins except of ‘male/grunt’
- 2 — do not allow any skins except of ‘male/grunt’ and ‘female/athena’

*TIP*: With `cl_noskins` set to 2, it is possible to keep just 2 model/skin pairs
(`male/grunt` and `female/athena`) to save memory and reduce map load times.
This will not affect model-based TDM gameplay, since any male skin will be
replaced by `male/grunt` and any female skin will be replaced by
`female/athena`.

#### `cl_rollhack`
Default OpenGL renderer in Quake 2 contained a bug that caused `roll` angle
of 3D models to be inverted during rotation.  Due to this bug, player
models did lean in the opposite direction when strafing. New Q2PRO renderer
doesn't have this bug, but since many players got used to it, Q2PRO is able
to simulate original behavior. This cvar chooses in which direction player
models will lean. Default value is 1 (invert `roll` angle).

#### `cl_adjustfov`
Specifies if horizontal field of view is automatically adjusted for screens
with aspect ratio different from 4/3. Default value is 1.

#### `cl_demosnaps`
Specifies time interval, in seconds, between saving `snapshots` in memory
during demo playback.  Snapshots enable backward seeking in demo (see `seek`
command description), and speed up repeated forward seeks. Setting this
variable to 0 disables snapshotting entirely. Default value is 10.

#### `cl_demomsglen`
Specifies default maximum message size used for demo recording. Default
value is 1390.  See `record` command description for more information on

Read-only cvar that indicates if the game is using shareware demo .pak files.

#### `ui_open`
Specifies if menu is automatically opened on startup, instead of full
screen console. Default value is 1 (open menu).

#### `ui_background`
Specifies image to use as menu background. Default value is empty, which
just fills the screen with solid black color.

#### `ui_scale`
Scaling factor of the UI widgets. Takes effect in OpenGL mode only. Default
value is 2. Automatically scales depending on current display resolution
when set to 0.

#### `ui_sortdemos`
Specifies default sorting order of entries in demo browser. Default value
is 1.  Negate the values for descending sorting order instead of ascending.

- 0 — don't sort
- 1 — sort by name
- 2 — sort by date
- 3 — sort by size
- 4 — sort by map
- 5 — sort by POV

#### `ui_listalldemos`
List all demos, including demos in packs and demos in base directories.
Default value is 0 (limit the search to physical files within the current
game directory).

#### `ui_sortservers`
Specifies default sorting order of entries in server browser. Default value
is 0.  Negate the values for descending sorting order instead of ascending.

- 0 — don't sort
- 1 — sort by hostname
- 2 — sort by mod
- 3 — sort by map
- 4 — sort by players
- 5 — sort by RTT

#### `ui_colorservers`
Enables highlighting of entries in server browser with different colors.
Currently, this option grays out password protected and anticheat enforced
servers. Default value is 0 (disabled).

#### `ui_pingrate`
Specifies the server pinging rate used by server browser, in packets per
second. Default value is 0, which estimates the default pinging rate based
on `rate` client variable.

#### `com_time_format`
Time format used by `com_time` macro. Default value is "%H.%M" on Win32 and
"%H:%M" on UNIX. See strftime(3) for syntax description.

#### `com_date_format`
Date format used by `com_date` macro. Default value is "%Y-%m-%d". See
strftime(3) for syntax description.

#### `backdoor`
Enables running the UDP server in single player mode. Mostly useful to
enable the remote console for game or renderer configuration with external
tools, for example [korgi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/korgi). When `backdoor`
is enabled, also set `rcon_password` to be nonempty. Default value is 0.

#### `uf`
User flags variable, automatically exported to game mod in userinfo.
Meaning and level of support of individual flags is game mod dependent.
Default value is empty. Commonly supported flags are reproduced below.
Flags 4 and 64 are supported during local demo playback. Flags 4-64 are
supported in MVD/GTV client mode.
  - 1 — auto screenshot at end of match
  - 2 — auto record demo at beginning of match
  - 4 — prefer user FOV over chased player FOV
  - 8 — mute player chat
  - 16 — mute observer chat
  - 32 — mute other messages
  - 64 — prefer chased player FOV over user FOV


Macros
------

Macros behave like automated console variables. When macro expansion is
performed, macros are searched first, then console variables.

### Macro expansion syntax

Each of the following examples are valid and produce the same output:
```
/echo $loc_here
/echo $loc_here$
/echo ${loc_here}
/echo ${$loc_here}
```

Commands
--------

### Client Demos

#### `demo [/]<filename[.ext]>`
Begins demo playback. This command does not require file extension to be
specified and supports filename autocompletion on TAB. Loads file from
`demos/` unless slash is prepended to `filename`, otherwise loads from the
root of quake file system. Can be used to launch MVD playback as well, if
MVD file type is detected, it will be automatically passed to the server
subsystem. To stop demo playback, type `disconnect`.

#### `seek [+-]<timespec>`
Seeks the given amount of time during demo playback.  Prepend with `+` to
seek forward relative to current position, prepend with `-` to seek
backward relative to current position. Without prefix, seeks to an absolute
position within the demo file. See below for _timespec_ syntax description.
Initial forward seek may be slow, so be patient.

*NOTE*: The `seek` command actually operates on demo frame numbers, not pure
server time.  Therefore, ‘seek +300’ does not exactly mean ‘skip 5 minutes of
server time’, but just means ‘skip 3000 demo frames’, which may account for
*more* than 5 minutes if there were dropped frames. For most demos, however,
correspondence between frame numbers and server time should be reasonably
close.

#### Demo time specification
Absolute or relative demo time can be specified in one of the following
formats:

* `.FF`, where `FF` are frames
* `SS`, where `SS` are seconds
* `SS.FF`, where `SS` are seconds, `FF` are frames
* `MM:SS`, where `MM` are minutes, `SS` are seconds
* `MM:SS.FF`, where `MM` are minutes, `SS` are seconds, `FF` are frames

#### `record [-hzes] <filename>`
Begins demo recording into `demos/_filename_.dm2`, or prints some
statistics if already recording. If neither `--extended` nor `--standard`
options are specified, this command uses maximum demo message size defined
by `cl_demomsglen` cvar.

* `-h` or `--help`: display help message
* `-z` or `--compress`: compress demo with gzip
* `-e` or `--extended`: use extended packet size (4086 bytes)
* `-s` or `--standard`: use standard packet size (1390 bytes)

*TIP*: With Q2PRO it is possible to record a demo while playing back another one.

#### `stop`
Stops demo recording and prints some statistics about recorded demo.

#### `suspend`
Pauses and resumes demo recording.

#### Demo packet sizes
Packet size options limit maximum demo message size and thus define
compatibility level of the recorded demo. Original Quake 2 supports just 1390
bytes (`standard` size), while Q2PRO and R1Q2 support message sizes up to 4086
bytes (`extended` size). When Q2PRO or R1Q2 protocols are in use, demo written
to disk is automatically downgraded to protocol 34. This can result in dropping
of large frames that don't fit into standard protocol 34 limit.  Demo packet
size can be extended to overcome this, but the resulting demo will be playable
only by Q2PRO and R1Q2 clients and will be incompatible with other Quake 2
clients or demo editing tools. By default, `standard` packet size is used. This
default can be changed using `cl_demomsglen` cvar.


### Cvar Operations

#### `toggle <cvar> [value1 value2 ...]`
If _values_ are omitted, toggle the specified _cvar_ between 0 and 1.
If two or more _values_ are specified, cycle through them.

#### `inc <cvar> [value]`
If _value_ is omitted, add 1 to the value of _cvar_.
Otherwise, add the specified floating point _value_.

#### `dec <cvar> [value]`
If _value_ is omitted, subtract 1 from the value of _cvar_.
Otherwise, subtract the specified floating point _value_.

#### `reset <cvar>`
Reset the specified _cvar_ to it's default value.

#### `resetall`
Resets all cvars to their default values.

#### `set <cvar> <value> [u|s|...]`
If 2 arguments are given, sets the specified _cvar_ to _value_.  If 3
arguments are given, and the last argument is `u` or `s`, sets _cvar_ to
_value_ and marks the _cvar_ with `userinfo` or `serverinfo` flags,
respectively.  Otherwise, sets _cvar_ to _value_, which is handled as
consisting from multiple tokens.

#### `setu <cvar> <value> [...]`
Sets the specified _cvar_ to _value_, and marks the cvar with `userinfo`
flag. _Value_ may be composed from multiple tokens.

#### `sets <cvar> <value> [...]`
Sets the specified _cvar_ to _value_, and marks the cvar with `serverinfo`
flag. _Value_ may be composed from multiple tokens.

#### `seta <cvar> <value> [...]`
Sets the specified _cvar_ to _value_, and marks the cvar with `archive`
flag. _Value_ may be composed from multiple tokens.

#### `cvarlist [-achlmnrstuvw:]`
Display the list of registered cvars and their current values with
filtering by cvar name or by cvar flags. If no options are given,
all cvars are listed. Supported options are reproduced below.

* `-a` or `--archive`: list archived cvars
* `-c` or `--cheat`: list cheat protected cvars
* `-h` or `--help`: display help message
* `-l` or `--latched`: list latched cvars
* `-m` or `--modified`: list modified cvars
* `-n` or `--noset`: list command line cvars
* `-r` or `--rom`: list read-only cvars
* `-s` or `--serverinfo`: list serverinfo cvars
* `-t` or `--custom`: list user-created cvars
* `-u` or `--userinfo`: list userinfo cvars
* `-v` or `--verbose`: display flags of each cvar
* `-w` or `--wildcard=<string>`: list cvars matching wildcard `string`

#### `macrolist`
Display the list of registered macros and their current values.


### Message Triggers

Message triggers provide a form of automatic command execution when some game
event occurs.  Each trigger is composed from a _command_ string to execute and
a _match_ string.  When a non-chat message is received from server, a list
of message triggers is examined.  For each trigger, _match_ is macro expanded
and wildcard compared with the message, ignoring any unprintable characters. If
the message matches, _command_ is stuffed into the command buffer and executed.

#### `trigger [<command> <match>]`
Adds new message trigger. When called without arguments, prints a list of
registered triggers.

#### `untrigger [all] | [<command> <match>]`
Removes the specified trigger. Specify _all_ to remove all triggers. When
called without arguments, prints a list of registered triggers.


### Chat Filters

Chat filters allow messages from annoying players to be ignored.  Each chat
filter is composed from a _match_ string.  When a chat message is received from
server, a list of chat filters is examined.  For each filter, _match_ is
wildcard compared with the message, ignoring any unprintable characters.  If
the message matches, it is silently dropped.

#### `ignoretext [match ...]`
Adds new chat filter. When called without arguments, prints a list of
registered filters.

#### `unignoretext [all] | [match ...]`
Removes the specified chat filter. Specify _all_ to remove all filters.
When called without arguments, prints a list of registered filters.

#### `ignorenick [nickname]`
Automatically composes and adds two chat filters: `_nickname_: *` and
`(_nickname_): *`. This command supports nickname completion.  When called
without arguments, prints a list of registered filters.

#### `unignorenick [nickname]`
Automatically composes and removes two chat filters: `_nickname_: *` and
`(_nickname_): *`. This command supports nickname completion. When called
without arguments, prints a list of registered filters.


### Draw Objects

Draw objects provide a uniform way to display values of arbitrary cvars and
macros on the game screen.  By default, text is positioned relative to the top
left corner of the screen, which has coordinates (0, 0). Use negative values to
align text to the opposite edge, e.g. point with coordinates (-1, -1) is at the
bottom right corner of the screen. Absolute value of each coordinate specifies
the distance from the corresponding screen edge, counted in pixels.

#### `draw <name> <x> <y> [color]`
Add console variable or macro identified by `name` (without the `$` prefix)
to the list of objects drawn on the screen at position (`x`, `y`), drawn
in optional `color`.

#### `undraw [all] | <name>`
Remove object identified by _name_ from the list of objects drawn on the
screen. Specify `all` to remove all objects.

#### Drawing FPS and a clock
```
/draw cl_fps -1 -1  // bottom right
/draw com_time 0 -1 // bottom left
```

### Screenshots

#### `screenshot [format]`
Standard command to take a screenshot. If `format` argument is given,
takes the screenshot in this format. Otherwise, takes in the format
specified by `gl_screenshot_format` variable. File name is picked up
automatically from the `screenshots/quakeNNN.EXT` template.

#### `screenshotpng [filename] [compression]`
Takes the screenshot in PNG format. If `filename` argument is given, saves
the screenshot into `screenshots/_filename_.png`. Otherwise, file name is
picked up automatically. If `compression` argument is given, saves with this
compression level. Otherwise, saves with `gl_screenshot_compression` level.

#### `screenshotjpg [filename] [quality]`
Takes the screenshot in JPG format. If `filename` argument is given, saves
the screenshot into `screenshots/_filename_.jpg`. Otherwise, file name is
picked up automatically. If `quality` argument is given, saves with this
quality level. Otherwise, saves with `gl_screenshot_quality` level.

#### `screenshottga [filename]`
Takes the screenshot in TGA format. If `filename` argument is given, saves
the screenshot into `screenshots/_filename_.tga`. Otherwise, file name is
picked up automatically.


### Locations

#### `loc_add <name ...>`
Adds new location with the specified name at current player position.

#### `loc_delete`
Deletes location closest to player position.

#### `loc_update <name ...>`
Changes name of location closest to player position.

#### `loc_write`
Saves current location list into `locs/<mapname>.loc` file.

*NOTE*: Edit locations on a local server and don't forget to execute `loc_write`
command once you are finished. Otherwise all changes to location list will be
lost on map change or disconnect.


### Miscellaneous

#### `vid_restart`
Perform complete shutdown and reinitialization of the renderer and video
subsystem. Rarely needed.

#### `fs_restart`
Flush all media registered by the client (textures, models, sounds, etc),
restart the file system and reload the current level.

#### `r_reload`
Flush and reload all media registered by the renderer (textures and models).
Weaker form of `fs_restart`.

*TIP*: In Q2PRO, you don't have to issue `vid_restart` after changing most of the
settings, a `fs_restart` or `r_reload` usually suffice. This helps to avoid
main window recreation and changing video modes back and forth, and is much
faster.

#### `passive`
Toggle passive connection mode. When enabled, client waits for the first
`passive_connect` packet from server and starts usual connection procedure
once this packet is received. This command is useful for connecting to
servers behind NATs or firewalls. See `pickclient [[server]]` command for
more details.

#### `serverstatus [address]`
Request the status string from the server at specified `address`,
display server info and list of players sorted by frags. If connected
to the server, `address` may be omitted, in this case current server is
queried.

#### `followip [count]`
Attempts to connect to the IP address recently seen in chat messages.
Optional `count` argument specifies how far to go back in message history
(it should be positive integer).  If `count` is omitted, then the most
recent IP address is used.

#### `ogg`

### Renderer

#### `reload_shader`
Reloads the shader binaries from compiled files. The files should be located
in the `shader_vkpt` folder within the game file system. Typically, they 
will be found in the `shaders.pkz` package, which can be overridden by
loose files in the `baseq2/shader_vkpt` folder if the game is built from source.
The command will also invoke the `compile_shaders.bat` script (on Windows)
before reolading the shaders.

#### `reload_textures`
Reloads the textures that were modified since the map load or previous use
of this command. Note that some aspects of the textures are not affected by
this reload, specifically the direct lighting information will not be 
recomputed on reload. Also, sometimes texture coordinates break after 
reloading the textures and then switching maps - in that case, restart the game.

#### `mat <command> <arguments...>`
The `mat` command provides an interface to the engine's material system and allows
inspecting, modifying and saving the materials. It has multiple sub-commands:
`help`, `print`, `which`, `save`, and all the material attributes. Use `mat help`
to get usage information.

#### `show_pvs`
Applies color coding to the map geometry that shows the surfaces within the same
BSP cluster as the surface pointed to (red) and surfaces within the PVS 
of that cluster (yellow). To clear the display, look at the sky and execute
`show_pvs` again.

#### `next_sun`
Switches to the next sun location preset, between night and dusk. See [`sun_preset`](#sun_preset)
for more information.

#### `drop_balls`
Moves the shader balls model to the current player location. See [`cl_shaderballs`](#cl_shaderballs)
for more information.

Incompatibilities
-----------------

Q2PRO client tries to be compatible with other Quake 2 ports, including
original Quake 2 release. Compatibility, however, is defined in terms of full
file format and network protocol compatibility. Q2PRO is not meant to be a
direct replacement of your regular Quake 2 client. Some features are
implemented differently in Q2PRO, some may be not implemented at all. You may
need to review your config and adapt it for Q2PRO. This section tries to
document most of these incompatibilities so that when something doesn't work as
it used to be you know where to look. The following list may be incomplete.

- Q2PRO has a built-in renderer and doesn't support run-time loading of external
  renderers.  Thus, `vid_ref` cvar has been made read-only and exists only for
  informational purpose.

- Default value of `gl_dynamic` variable has been changed from 1 to 2. This means
  dynamic lights will be disabled by default.

- Changes to `gl_modulate` variable in Q2PRO take effect immediately. To set
  separate modulation factors for world lightmaps and entities please use
  `gl_modulate_world` and `gl_modulate_entities` variables.

- Default value of R1GL-specific `gl_dlight_falloff` variable has been changed
  from 0 to 1.

- `gl_particle_*` series of variables are gone, as well as
  `gl_ext_pointparameters` and R1GL-specific `gl_ext_point_sprite`. For
  controlling size of particles, which are always drawn as textured triangles,
  Q2PRO supports it's own `gl_partscale` variable.

- `ip` variable has been renamed to `net_ip`.

- `clientport` variable has been renamed to `net_clientport`, and
  `ip_clientport` alias is no longer supported.

- `demomap` command has been removed in favor of `demo` and `mvdplay`.

- Q2PRO works only with virtual paths constrained to the quake file system.
  All paths are normalized before use so that it is impossible to go past virtual
  filesystem root using `../` components.  This means commands like these are
  equivalent and all reference the same file: `exec ../global.cfg`, `exec
  /global.cfg`, `exec global.cfg`.  If you have any config files in your Quake 2
  directory root, you should consider moving them into `baseq2/` to make them
  accessible.

- Likewise, `link` command syntax has been changed to work with virtual paths
  constrained to the quake file system. All arguments to `link` are normalized.

- Cinematics are not supported.

- Joysticks are not supported.

- Single player savegame format has been rewritten from scratch for better
  robustness and portability. Only the `baseq2` game library included in Q2PRO
  distribution has been converted to use the new improved savegame format. Q2PRO
  will refuse to load and save games in old format for security reasons.

- CD music is not supported, only OGG Vorbis music is supported.
