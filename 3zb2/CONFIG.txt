File List
=========

3zbconfig.cfg	Configuration file for bot infomation and server message 
3zbmaps.lst	Maplist file

Route chain files (*.ch[n|f]) contain information on objects and level navigation

./chdtm/*.chn	deathmatch chaining file
./chctf/*.chf	Capture The Flag chaining file

- See below on how to create chaining route files.


Setup and Run
=============

1. Unzip file and directory under your Quake2 diretory,and run Quake2 like below

	quake2 +set game 3zb2

2. Start deathmatch mode.

*** Note 1 ***
To make bot map navigation better, you must place the route chain file(*.chn) under \3zb2\chdtm

e.g. To play on map "q2dm1", provide chain route file "q2dm1.chn".

*** Note 2 ***
This bot is supported in Quake II Mission Pack 1 "The Reckoning".
If you want to play with bots on Reckoning's map, copy the \xatrix\pak0.pak
to \3zb2.

*** Note 3 ***
To play CTF with bots, copy the pak files ctf\pak*.pak to \3zb2. 

- NOTE: Remember to rename existing pak files: pakX.pak (X=any other number).

sv	rmb	$	Remove $ of bots
sv	dsp	$	Debug spawning, make bot run $ from oldposition
sv	savechain	Save the chaining route file

Chaining routes
===============

1. Ensure you have a *user writable* chaining file in the correct directory

	- If a new level, create an empty file.

e.g.	touch 3zb2/chctf/q2ctf3.chf
	touch 3zb2/chdtm/q2dm8.chn


2. Start game and set the value "chedit" to 1 in console

	chedit 1

3. Start the game map to learn

	map q2dm8

4. Roam around the map

5. If you use the elevator via button, ensure the bot can use it correctly.

eg. If you want to make bot run 20 previous pod positions to current pod

	sv dsp 20 

If the bot can move to the current pod, bot will be removed automatically.
If the bot fails to trace chaining, bot will also be removed automatically.

When do you want to move back 20 pod postions in chaining, type

	cmd undo 20

6. When chaining ends, save the chaining route file.
   Will be saved file under "chdtm" directory.

	sv savechain

Note:
- Don't attempt tricky moves (Rocket Jump, Grenade Jump)
- If you die (lava, slime, etc...), the route will be fixed to a safe route.
- If bot isn't removed automatically, execute remove command. ( sv rmb 1 )

Map List
========

You setup map looping patterns in "3zbmaps.lst".

1. Write pattern section name between "[" and "]".
2. Write mapname below section. 
3. Start Quake2.
4. Set the section name to console-value "maplist"

e.g. If the section name is "list1"

	maplist list1
 
5. Start deathmatch mode on one map within the list.
