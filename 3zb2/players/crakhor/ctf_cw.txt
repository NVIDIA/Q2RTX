CTF skins for the Crackwhore.
I knocked these up on the night the crackwore was released, hope you like them.
The legs are plain because after a point there's nothing else you can really do so 
I tried to make it look like leggings under shorts.

Anything I didn't do myself was grabbed from and or altered form the orriginal 
skins that came with Q2 from id software

Put all the PCX files in the 'crakhor' dir in 'baseq2' you will probably 
want to copy the .WAV files from the female model in there too or she'll sound like a bloke.
