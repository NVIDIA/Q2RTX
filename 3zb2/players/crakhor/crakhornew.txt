Description: Simply put a kick ass version of a completly redone crackwhore.
no this is not a lame redo of the originals, but a completely retooled skin, rather than being some two cent slut that looks like complete shit. (Sorry paul nice model horrid skins :) ) she looks like a supermodel that is ready to kick ass, to give you an idea it looks kinda like brianna wearing the cobalt skin armor. (yes i used id's original female skins as the base for this one.) but i did alot of work to her hair and face so she looks alot different. rather than being a silicone slut she actually looks nice (cept her slutty frames in the model dont complement her well :) ) but ol well im not complainin.. People who use the crackwhore are advised to get this and use it, as it is also my clans skin for the crackwhore (this version doesnt have the emblem on her back so you wont have the real V.o.D skin.) if the response is good i will make ctf skins for her and release them asap i hope that you will enjoy using this skin as much as i had makin it :)
