This skin has a grey background, so it should be useful as a base for further skins - just draw over the top of this skin.  Also included in the ZIP is a BMP image of the wireframe model - or base skin.  You will see that there's some really weird abberations in the skin.  The hands are really small.  The legs have a huge kink in the middle, making texture mapping a bit crazy on the model's legs.  

This was my first skin for the Crackwhore PPM, I will probably do a few more using this skin as a base and changing colours and face pictures around.
