y'know its time for the story type shit...

Krakklov was a genetic experiment, the U.S.S.R. mixed alien DNA
with our own human version of the stuff (DNA).

It created a creature like no other thing on Earth.
Krakklov was born.

Krakklov's first job was as a super soldier for the Russian federation
where he was taught all his weaponry skills. He became effiect in all
types of weaponry from Blasters to BFG10Ks. He was hard.
But after a few months with the militia on Olympus mons doing
training he became suspisious. He had heard the generals talking with
medics, they where going to kill him off! The fools...

...after a short while the entire battalion was dead except for
Krakklov, who had gone postal and wiped out everyone.

He ran to the landing bay and stole a ship. Inside he saw a T.V.
transmitting some sort of announcement, 
"As these brave soldiers embark upon their mission to the Strogg's
homeworld..."

"hmmm," he thought, "I could make serious money off some Strogg heads,
but first..."
and with that he headed for Earth.

He landed on Earth and met up with the local Moscow crimeboss, HoKla
who said, "bring me back say, umm, 300 strogg skulls and a few
artifacts, and its a deal,"

Krakklov headed for the U.S. On his way he saw a huge ship fly out into
space, "ahh, my little freinds, wait for me..."
He changes course and follows the ship.

Through the black hole...

Ready for planetfall...

He flys into the atmosphere of Stroggos and clips some guy, uhh
Bitterman I think...

as he lands he finds a horde of Strogg soldiers waiting on the ground.
"Lets start knocking heads," he thinks, as he step into the fray...
