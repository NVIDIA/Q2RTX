SKIN NAME: Darlene
INFO: It's just a skin I converted over from the very first Quake2
skin I did for the Female model. I figured that the Crackwhore model
was a better showcase for it. I created my first Darlene skin so long 
ago I was still using the Quake2 base skins. Ah times have 
changed and I have vowed to never do that again; it's no fun. Anyway,
hope you enjoy the skin and the drawing. 

Thanks to id for making such a kick ass game, Paul Steed for making such
a kick ass model, and to all you fraggers out there that kick my ass, 
inspiring me to make skins to adorn you.

Peace, (fuck that, WAR!!)

btw, the name for the skin is a Led Zeppelin song if anyone cares.
