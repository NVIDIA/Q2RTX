Description:  

This started as a project to make a skin for the Cyborg that looked like the 
Borg out of Star Trek.  Instead it ended up like a cool mutant cross between 
the Terminator, the Borg, and a Strogg.  This was my first attempt at a skin and 
all in all I think it came out pretty good.  Enjoy.


Notes: I plan to have an improved and better looking version of this bad boy out
in the near future.
