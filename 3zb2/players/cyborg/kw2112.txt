kw2112 Q2 Cyborg Skin
=====================

This zip contains a new and blue skin for id's cyborg maodel. I made
this just because the 3.12 release only contained 3 cyborg skins.
While they are very sexy, the colours are boring.

kw2112.pcx is the actual skin. It is mainly just a copy, paste
and recolour of id's cyborg skin, although there are some changes (such
as the midriff-type area). I was going to make a more radically
different skin, but I got some wierd stretching problems.
It's even named like the id skins.

kw2112.pcx is the mugshot for the scorescreen. This is totally new.

To have a nice, blue cyborg skin just put the two .pcx files in your
baseq2/players/cyborg dir. and then select it either in the player
setup screen or by typing "skin cyborg/kw2112" at the console.
