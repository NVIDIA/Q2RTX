Kinrad the Cyborg Skin
----------------------

Skin by: Dark Nova
Model by: Paul Steed (I think)

Information
-----------
Hopefully this is the first skin made for the new Cyborg Model Id so
generously gave us in the Point Release.  Unfortunately, I hope
that all the people having problems and fixing their computers from
the PR will be able to use this.  Technically, it's a Ctf Blue skin
(There's already a red one), but I went a bit farther to make the logo
and skin--it's blue, yes, and looks a bit corny, but it's my first shot
at the difficult-to-skin Cyborg PPM.
