Instructions:	Just unzip these files into your 
	        quake2/baseq2/players/cyborg directory
                and select the skin in Multiplayer mode.

Description: 	I think this is the first custom made skin for the cyborg model. I wanted the BoS
		clan to have something that stood out, but not blatantly, hence the gold-brown 
		armor. The skin is a hodge-podge of 3 id skins, 2 users skins, and a some 
		original changes.

Hints:		If you are creating team skins for your clan using photoshop, make several 
		different layers for the skin. Put the flesh parts on their own layer. 
		This makes it easy if you have to change skin colors for different team members. 
		Put armor on its on layer so you can easily colorize or change the hue of the 
		suit without having to select all the different parts, and have a layer for 
		custom accessories/cybernetics/tatoos for individuals. Save as a PSD. If you 
		get a new clan member, just ask them what they want different from the other 
		team members and you'll have a customized skin done in no time.

		BTW, building a skin around the wireframe PCX leaves jags...paint more than you 
		are required to prevent that tearing look (I've included a wireframe of the 
		cyborg model for those daring enough to create a skin from scratch).
