
Grimlock's Coloured/Teamplay Skin Pack
======================================

Description
-----------
This pack contains 10 different coloured skins for the three player
models that have been released by id. The male and female skins are
based on the blue CTF skins while the cyborg skins are mostly based on
the ps9000 skin.

I made this skin pack specifically for teamplay with Ridah's
most sexy Eraser bots (http://impact.frag.com). As the skins for both
the sexes are complimentary, you can create teams consisting of both
males and females and still maintain uniformity of appearance.

Installation
------------
Simply unzip all files to your baseq2/players directory (making sure
you use folder names).

To use them with Erasers edit your bots.cfg so the teams (and/or bots)
use the colours you think look best.
Tip: Good people make teams based on skins, not gender.

Some colours are perhaps too similar to others. I decided to keep all
10 to give you the say in what colours do/not get used.

Credit
------
I'm in no way taking credit for the skins themselves.
Despite all the skins out there, I believe that those released by id
are still the best. That's why I've used them as a base.

I don't see the point in making skins from scratch when there is no
downloading of files like there is in QuakeWorld. When (if) this is
added then I'll feel that the effort involved in making good,
original skins is justified and will make some then.

Since I did put this pack together, if you are going to distribute
it on a CD or such mail me first, or else you're very naughty.
