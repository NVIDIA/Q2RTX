Cyborg CTF skins
================

Simply put the 4 .pcx files in baseq2/players/cyborg

Here you will find some skins for the cyborg model for use in CTF.
I got the first lot of cyborg skins, but then realised the colours were off.
Being the jerk that I am, that wasn't good enough so I made my own.
These skins are basically the oni911 head on the ps9000 body- naturally
with the colours changed to match the male and female skins.

No credit to me. I did nothing a small child couldn't have done.
