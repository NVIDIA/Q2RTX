  * Restore specular on materials with roughness = 1, but make specular on rough dielectrics much dimmer.
  
**Shading and BRDF improvements:**

  * Fixed scaling of diffuse and specular reflections: https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX/issues/37
  * Fixed relative brightness and spotlight terms for different light types.
  * Hemisphere sampling for indirect diffuse tuned to make the results better match the cosine-weighted sampling in reference mode.
  * Trace more specular rays for shiny metals that do not need indirect diffuse lighting.

  * Tuned fake specular to be closer to reference specular.
  * Added normalization of normal map vectors on load to avoid false roughness adjustments by the Toksvig factor.
  * Improved roughness correction to not happen on texture magnification, and to better handle cases like zero roughness.
  * Fixed the computation of N.V to avoid potential NaNs: https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX/issues/23

**Misc Improvements:**

  * Removed the multiplayer specific sun position setting, and changed the remaining setting to be morning by default.
  * Changed the default value of texture LOD bias to 0 for extra sharpness.
  * Use nearest filter for upscaling from 50% resolution scale (a.k.a integer scaling).
  * Made the brightness of sprites, beams, particles, smoke, and effects like quad damage be similar to overall scene brightness, to avoid having them washed out under direct sunlight.
  * Made the explosions and other sprites appear in low-roughness specular reflections.
  * Changed the flare lights to be derived from the flare model entity instead of the effect event, which makes the lights follow the flares smoothly in flight, and reduces flicker that was due to frequent light creation and destruction.
  * Removed insane and dead soldiers with `nomonsters 1`.
  * Random number generator now produces enough different sequences to cover thousands of frames for reference mode accumulation.
  * The `pt_direct_polygon_lights` cvar has a new meaning when set to -1: all polygon lights are sampled through the indirect lighting shader, for comparison purposes.
  * Moved the first person player model a bit backwards to avoid having it block reflections.
